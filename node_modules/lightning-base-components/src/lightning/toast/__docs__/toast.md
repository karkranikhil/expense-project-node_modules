The `LightningToast` component displays a toast notification with an icon, label, message, and links. Use a toast to convey small pieces of information to the user, providing feedback and confirmation after the user takes an action. Toasts can disappear after a certain duration or until the user clicks the close button.

### Show a Toast

To show a toast, call the static function `show(config, comp)` from `lightning/toast` and provide a toast configuration and a reference of the local component as parameters.
The function also creates a single page-level toast container if one does not exist.

```javascript
// c/myComponent.js
import { LightningElement } from 'lwc';
import Toast from 'lightning/toast';

export default class MyComponent extends LightningElement {
    ...
    onClick() {
        ...
        Toast.show({
            label: 'This is a toast label which shows {0}, you can learn more about its accessibility from {1}',
            labelLinks : [{
                url: 'https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/toast/',
                label: 'LDS link'
            }, {
                url: 'https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/accessibility/guidelines/global-focus/#toasts',
                label: 'toast guideline'
            }],
            message: 'I want to show a {salesforceLink} and a {slackLink}',
            messageLinks: {
                salesforceLink: {
                    url: 'http://www.salesforce.com',
                    label: 'Salesforce link'
                },
                slackLink: {
                    url: 'https://slack.com',
                    label: 'Slack link'
                }
            },
            mode: 'sticky',
            variant: 'info'
        }, this);
    }
}
```
In this example, the toast configuration uses two ways to specify links (see note below). The toast displays a sticky mode informational toast message with a `label` string as the toast title and a `message` string as the toast message.  The `{0}`, `{1}`, `{salesforceLink}`, and `{slackLink}` placeholders are replaced with their `url` specified links.

A page-level [`LightningToastContainer` component](/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-toast-container/documentation) manages and displays the toast component.

**_NOTE:_** `label` can have index-based or name-based link placeholders. In the case of index-based link placeholders, `labelLinks` must be defined as an array, otherwise, `labelLinks` must be defined as a map. Same applies to `message`.

### Component Styling

`LightningToast` implements the [toast](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/toast/) blueprint in the Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS). [SLDS styling hooks](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/toast/#Styling-Hooks-Overview) aren't supported with programmatic creation of toasts via `Toast.show()`.

### `config` attributes

 Attribute | Description  |
|----------| ------------ |
| `label` (required) | Title of the toast, it can contain placeholders in the form of `{0} ... {N}` (index-based) or `{name} ... {someOtherName}` (name-based). The placeholders are replaced with the links on `labelLinks`. |
| `labelLinks` | [{url, label}], which replaces the `{0} ... {N}` indexed placeholders in `label` or `{ name: {url, label} }`, which replaces the `{name} ... {someOtherName}` named placeholders in `label`. |
| `message` | Description of the toast, it can contain placeholders in the form of `{0} ... {N}` (index-based) or `{name} ... {someOtherName}` (name-based). The placeholders are replaced with the links on `messageLinks`. |
| `messageLinks` | [{url, label}], which replaces the `{0} ... {N}` indexed placeholders in `message` or `{ name: {url, label} }`, which replaces the `{name} ... {someOtherName}` named placeholders in `message`. |
| `variant` | Appearance of the toast. |
| `mode` | Persistence of the toast. |

**_NOTE:_**  When `labelLinks` (or `messageLinks`) is passed to the `config` parameter, the content of `label` (or `message`) is rendered using [`lightning-formatted-rich-text`](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-formatted-rich-text/documentation). consult the documentation for expected result when link presents.

#### `variant` attribute

The `variant` attribute sets the component's color and icon. It supports these values.

| Value | Color | Icon |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `info` (default) | grey | `utility:info`|
| `success` | green | `utility:success`|
| `warning` | orange | `utility:warning`|
| `error` | red | `utility:error`|

#### `mode` attribute

The `mode` attribute sets the component's dismissal. It supports these values.
-   `dismissible` - The component automatically disappears after a certain duration. The user can dismiss it early by clicking the close button. The time duration for `dismissible` is 4.8 seconds, or 9.6 seconds if the toast contains a link.
-   `sticky` - The component stays on screen until the user clicks the close button.

##### Default Mode
If a `mode` value isn't provided, the default `mode` is determined by the value of `variant` and whether the `toast` has a link or links present in `label` or `message`.

| Variant | Has link? | Default Mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `info` | Yes| `sticky`|
| `info` | No | `sticky`|
| `success` | Yes | `sticky`|
| `success` | No | `dismissible`|
| `warning` | Yes | `sticky`|
| `warning` | No | `sticky`|
| `error` | Yes | `sticky`|
| `error` | No | `sticky`|

#### Small screen / Mobile environment

`LightningToast` is responsive to your screen resolution. For smaller screens or mobile environments, the toast's **icon** and **description** (i.e. text stored in `message`, and `messageLinks`) is **not shown** due to the screen's width limitation (see [Toast blueprint screen variants](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/guidelines/messaging/components/toasts/#flavor-variants-screen).

On small screens and mobile environments, we recommend that you provide links in the toast's title (ie `label` and `labelLinks`) in order to have links visible and interactive.
